## Work Experience 
Worked as [Sessional Lecturer](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/abonela/) at 
[La Trobe University](https://www.latrobe.edu.au) 
for the following post-graduate subjects: 
* [Deep Learning](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2024/CSE5DL?year=2024)
* [Big Data Management on Cloud](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2023/CSE5BDC?year=2023)
* [Data Mining](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2023/CSE5DMI?year=2023) 

In the past, I worked as an A.I. Researcher, Lab Demonstrator and Research 
Officer.
As a lab demonstrator, I have taught concepts like fundamental 
programming language concepts to complex machine & deep learning 
algorithm concepts. In addition, I also taught data engineering concepts 
that make use parallel processing or distributed computing frameworks like Apache 
Spark to process large scale data.

### Accolades
I received very good and memorable feedback from students and my subject 
coordinators for my teaching and demonstration skills.


## Research Interests
Currently, I am working on developing a multimodal algorithm (from scratch) 
that can combine two different modalities: Images and Text.
