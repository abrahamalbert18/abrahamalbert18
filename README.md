# Dr. Abraham Albert

### Educational Background 
* Ph.D. in Applied Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)
* Master of Data Science

### Work Experience 
Worked as [Sessional Lecturer](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/abonela/) at 
[La Trobe University](https://www.latrobe.edu.au) 
for the following post-graduate subjects: 
* [Deep Learning](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2024/CSE5DL?year=2024)
* [Big Data Management on Cloud](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2023/CSE5BDC?year=2023)
* [Data Mining](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2023/CSE5DMI?year=2023) 

I received very good and memorable feedback from students for my teaching 
skills.

In the past, I worked as an A.I. Researcher, Lab Demonstrator and Research 
Officer.

As a lab demonstrator, I have taught concepts like fundamental 
programming language concepts to complex machine & deep learning 
algorithm concepts. In addition, I also taught data engineering concepts 
that make use parallel processing or distributed computing frameworks like Apache 
Spark to process large scale data.


### Research Interests
Currently, I am working on developing a multimodal algorithm (from scratch) 
that can combine two different modalities: Images and Text.

During my Ph.D., I worked on various research and development projects that 
included domains: computer vision, speech processing, and natural language 
processing. I have published multiple scientific research articles in high impact 
journals including Nature's _Scientific Reports_. Please find my research profile [here](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/abonela/publications).

#### Personal Projects
[Forever Dreaming](https://github.com/abrahamalbert18/ForeverDreaming): In 
this project, I successfully developed a mini-version of transformer based 
Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using PyTorch. This model is trained using 
Engilsh transcripts of T.V. Series.

#### Ph.D. Projects
[ADLAIA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0741832922001288?via%3Dihub)
, a speech based algorithm I developed to identify whether a person is 
sober or inebriated using 12-seconds of audio clip, was recognised worldwide by both 
public health researchers and media.

[ABIDLA2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.14925), an 
image based algorithm I developed to identify and detect alcoholic beverages 
from images, was recognised worldwide by public health researchers 
(including accolades from Harvard University Professor).
It was recognised as an article of public interest by _Alcoholism Clinical and 
Experimental Research (ACER)_ journal.

[LYDIA](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/59/2/agad088/7564671), is a 
text based algorithm that can process the song lyrics and identify and detect 
both alcohol related keywords and their connotation. This research article 
was published in _Alcohol and Alcoholism_ journal. 

#### Master's Thesis Project
During my Master's degree, I have developed two deep learning algorithms 
(multi-task learning based algorithm and variational autoencoder based 
algorithm) that can extract phenotypes from time-lapse footage of the 
_Arabidopsis Thaliana_ plant and used them to find associations with plant genotypes.
