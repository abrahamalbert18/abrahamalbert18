# Dr. Abraham Albert

### Educational Background 
* Ph.D in Applied Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)
* Master of Data Science

### Work Experience 
I am currently working as a [Sessional Lecturer](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/abonela/) at [La Trobe University](https://www.latrobe.edu.au) 
teaching the following post-graduate subjects: 
* [Deep Learning](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2024/CSE5DL?year=2024)
* [Big Data Management on Cloud](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2023/CSE5BDC?year=2023)
* [Data Mining](https://handbook.latrobe.edu.au/subjects/2023/CSE5DMI?year=2023) 

I received very good feedback from students for my teaching skills.

In the past, I worked as an A.I. Researcher, Lab Demonstrator and Research 
Officer.

As a lab demonstrator, I have taught concepts like fundamental 
programming language concepts to training complex machine & deep learning 
algorithms. In addition, I also taught big data processing concepts that 
make use parallel processing or distributed computing frameworks like Apache 
Spark.


### Research Interests
Currently, I am working on developing a multimodal algorithms that can combine 
two different modalities: Images and Text.

During my Ph.D., I worked on various research and development projects that 
included domains: computer vision, speech processing, and natural language 
processing. I have published multiple scientific research articles in high impact 
journals including Nature's _Scientific Reports_. Please find my research profile [here](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/abonela/publications).

During my Master's degree, I have developed two deep learning algorithms 
that can extract phenotypes from time-lapse footage of the _Arabidopsis 
Thaliana_ plant and used them to find an association with genotypes.
